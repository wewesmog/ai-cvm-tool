## 🚀 Solo Development Best Practices

### **MVP-First Approach**
- **Each phase is deployable** independently
- **User feedback** after each phase
- **No feature creep** - stick to core functionality
- **Simple solutions** over complex ones

### **Technology Choices for Solo Dev**
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built components (no custom UI)
- **FastAPI**: Minimal boilerplate, auto-docs
- **PostgreSQL**: Single database, no microservices
- **React Flow**: Visual editor without custom canvas
- **OpenAI API**: AI features without ML expertise

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Start simple**: Basic CRUD before AI
- **Test early**: Deploy after each phase
- **User validation**: Get feedback before building more
- **Documentation**: Keep notes for future reference

### **Time Management**
- **2 hours/day** during weekdays
- **4-6 hours** on weekends
- **Focus on one phase** at a time
- **Don't over-engineer** early features
